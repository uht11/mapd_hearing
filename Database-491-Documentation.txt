Documentation for Database 

The following are the three users in the database with various privileges
Front-end user (GRANT privilege: SELECT)
	Username: frontenduser
	Password: mypass
Write user (GRANT privilege: INSERT)
	Username: writeuser
	Password: writepass
Admin ((GRANT privilege: ALL) 
	Username: myuser
	Password: mypass

Creation of database and tables:
The following command creates the database
	CREATE DATABASE MAPD;
	USE MAPD;
The following commands are used to create a table and add various constraints such as primary key, secondary key, etc 
	CREATE TABLE test ( user_id varchar(20) not null, password varchar(20) not null);
	ALTER TABLE test ADD CONSTRAINT test_pk PRIMARY KEY ( user_id );


Testcases for front-end user:
Inserting data as a frontend user
	INSERT INTO test ( user_id, password ) VALUES ('mpd34', 'test123');
	Error msg:  INSERT command denied to user 'frontenduser'@'localhost' for table 'test'
Reading the data (using SELECT)
	SELECT * FROM test;
Deleting data as a frontend user
	DELETE FROM test;
	DELETE command denied to user 'frontenduser'@'localhost' for table 'test'

Testcases for write user:
Inserting data as a write user
	INSERT INTO test ( user_id, password ) VALUES ( 'mc26', '12345');
Reading the data (using SELECT)
	SELECT * FROM test;
	Error msg: SELECT command denied to user 'writeuser'@'localhost' for table 'test'
Deleting data as a write user
	DELETE FROM test;
	Error msg: DELETE command denied to user 'writeuser'@'localhost' for table 'test'
