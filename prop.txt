Topic: The mind-body problem.

My position:

I take the position that mind and body are two different entities. I believe that the monist and materialist account doesnâ€™t answer the question of causal interaction between mind and body. In addition to that, some quantum theories suggest us the existence of non-material entities that support the existence of mind.

Opposing positions:

The opposing position is that there exist only material entities in this world and the mind or non-physical entities are just brain activities.

Introductory paragraph:

The idea of an independent mind comes from the notion of dualism, the thesis that says there exists an entity free from our body. It has been at the center of debate since ancient times when philosophers used to support their positions through deduction and inference. As modern science has progressed, the debate has been framed from a new ground based on the empirical findings. The most advanced progress in neuroscience and molecular biology has suggested us many premises that have made the problem more complicated than ever. If the mind being our consciousness and the body being our brain are separate parts, do they relate to each other and work together? If they are one, do they depend on each other? The idea that the mind and body are one is called monism and the idea that the mind and body are separate is called dualism. In my paper, I will argue that the mind and body are separate and there exist non-physical entities independent of our body.
